        Sportikus Sporting Goods was founded in 2005 by a greek immigrant and
        gold medal winning decathlete, Cosmo Kramer.
        <br /><br />
        Cosmo's dream was to win the gold and then help others to know it feels
        to crush the competition and look good while doing it!
        <br /><br />
        After retiring from his athletic career, Cosmo found a way to achieve
        the second part of his goal by founding his own chain of sporting goods
        stores that would provide all of the gear you need to compete and look
        your best.
